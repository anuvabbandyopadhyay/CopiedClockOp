# Analog Clock!ðŸ˜Ž

Dark themed Clock
How did we build it ?
Websites really amazes me ! I was curious to know how programmers can make all these stylish websites.Does it really require hours of coding and complicated softwares or does it happen in a jiffy ?
I decided to figure out the adventure and of course my friend, Ashwath came out to join this !
We both decided to look up a bit on google about html,css ,js and with help of some youtube videos .
We were really enthusiastic and curious to know about front end development.


What is it actually ?
Clock which we designed in dark theme.We learned about css designing and element development in html.
